# 2D-Tank-Pygame-README

This is a 2D eagle eye view tank game I made for my grade 11 computer science summative, just thought I would upload it to GitHub if anyone would like to check it out!

Note, if you are trying to download and run the game, you're going to need to install python and pygame then you're going to have to run "main.py"

I hope you enjoy the game!
